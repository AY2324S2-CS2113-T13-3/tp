## Preface
With the increased competitiveness of cohorts in Singapore, tuition centres have become more prevalent than ever before. 

According to a **[newspaper article](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/families-spent-14b-on-private-tuition-for-kids-last-year-as-parents-fork-out)** in The Straits Times, billions of dollars are spent in the tuition industry in Singapore every single year. 

These are just the numbers in Singapore. If we go to other countries, the situation is much worse. In India, new tuition centres preparing students for competitive entrance exams like JEE and NEET spring up every single day.

In such a fast-growing market, it is important that these tuition centres use better and more efficient student management systems to increase efficiency and automation of manual laborious tasks.

These systems enable tutors and administrative staff to focus on more pressing issues and work on catering to every students' needs instead of being swamped with paperwork.

## Introduction

Classify is a student management system meant to assist administrative staff of private tuition centres. 

The product is capable of storing students, and generating outputs based on provided parameters, such as phone number, or subjects taken.

Within our program, a student can be stored with their 
- Subjects taken
- Number grades of those subjects
- Phone Number
- Gender
- Last Payment Date
- Remarks

We have determined these to be the attributes important to running a working tuition centre. Based on these attributes, our program also has functions to sort students based on subjects taken.

# Usage

**Please note that any of the following characters are banned in any string prompts, `#, -`  and `~` in all fields except for the date of payment field.**

### Adding a student: `add`
Initialises an interface for adding a student and their relevant details to the database. Allows the user to do add or add [name]

Students of the same name can be added so long as they possess a different phone number. Students with the same phone number can be added so long as they have different names.

User is expected to add only student's name as registered in NRIC or passport. 

The first letter of the student's name will be capitalised, while the 2nd letter onwards will be lowercase, regardless of initial input.

However, if the name contains multiple parts, each corresponding first letter after every space will be capitalised as well.

Example:
- James wong bing xuan -> James Wong Bing Xuan
- james WONG BING XUAN -> James Wong Bing Xuan
- jaMeS WONG binG Xuan -> James Wong Bing Xuan

**Format:** `add` or `add NAME`

Depending on whether the user entered the student's name or not during the command, fields will be printed out in the terminal, awaiting a user input each time.

Please note that the user input NUMBER (shown below) must be an *8-digit number starting with 8 or 9*. 
Thus, please be informed and educated that our software only works in countries that have phone numbers that are 8 digits long and start with 8 or 9.

Do note that the subject field will allow numbers as well, since lessons such as Chinese1E and Chinese1H are legitimate class names, which could signify express and higher mother tongue respectively.
As such, it is on the onus of the user to not use nonsensical names for the subjects, to ensure that the database is sensible.

Last payment date must be within a range from 1970-01-01 to the day after the current date. This is a buffer to account for situations when storing dates, such as for audit reasons.

The gender field and remarks section are optional, hence if the user presses `enter`, they would proceed with the next command or end the add student interface respectively.


#### Example usage:
``` 
add wario

Subject (enter nothing to skip): 
SUBJECT

Current marks out of 100 (blank to skip) : 
100

Enter Classes Attended (blank to skip):
1

Do you want to add another subject and grade? (yes/no) 
no

Please input a valid Phone number: 
Enter a non-number or blank to exit interface.
89718971

Please input the student's gender:
male

Please input their last payment date in the format of YYYY-MM-DD. Enter blank to input today's date.
14-04-2024

Please input any remarks:
He likes turtles

Student added successfully!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```
For any student that exists within the program's master, archive and recently deleted list, the user cannot add new students with a name-phone number pair that matches that of the existing student.

The following is an example of trying to add a new student that matches the name and phone number of an already existing student.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Example usage:
```
add melodie
Subject (enter nothing to skip):
No subjects added.
Please input a valid phone number:
Enter a non-number or blank to exit interface.
88888888
Student and Phone number pair found. If not found in the list, please restore or unarchive the student instead.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

###  View details of a student `view`

Views a student's details. Allows the user to do view [name] or just view.

**Format:** `view` or `view NAME`

Depending on whether the user entered the student's name or not during the command, fields will be printed out in the terminal, awaiting a user input each time.
If user enters different letter cases from name stored data, the system will still match strings regardless of letter case for user intuitiveness.

How it works (cases for input):
- In the list: Stored as `James Wong`
- view James Wong -> James Wong
- view james wong -> james wong
- view JAMES WONG -> JAMES WONG
  * Regardless of what capitalisation the user uses for the name, the program will recognise that upper and lower cases should return the same student.


#### Example usage:
``` 
view wario

Student details: 
Name: wario
Phone Number: 97655678
Gender: male
Last Payment Date: 12/12/2023
Remarks: Unknown
Subject: subject
Current marks out of 100: 100.0
Classes Attended: 1
```

Note that if 2 people of the same name are present in the list, the program will prompt the user to differentiate them through a choice between the available phone numbers tagged to them.

### Delete a student from the working list `delete`
Deletes the student from the list. Allows the user to do delete [student] or just delete.

**Format:** `delete` or `delete NAME`

Depending on whether the user entered the student's name or not during the command, 
a field will be printed out in the terminal, awaiting a user input.


#### Example usage:
``` 
delete
Enter student name: 
wario
Student removed successfully!
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Edit details of a student `edit`
Edit a student's details and subjects. Allows the user to do edit [student] or just edit.

**Format:** `edit` or `edit NAME`

If user has not entered a name, they will be prompted to input a name.
Once program received name input, the student master list will be searched for the name. Name search is not case-sensitive.

If the name input matches that of an existing student, edit mode will be entered for that student.
If 2 students with the same name is found, the user will be prompted to enter the desired student's phone number to select them.

In edit mode, a list of actions will be printed and user can choose from a list of actions to take.
The following actions (listed along with their indexes) can be executed:
- 1 Add new subject to student
- 2 Modify student's existing subject
- 3 Delete student's existing subject
- 4 Modify student's phone number
- 5 Modify student's remarks
- 6 Modify student's payment date
- 7 Modify student's gender

The user can enter the action's index to execute the respective action, e.g. user can input "1" to add new subject.

Each action has its own step by step prompts for user to follow, as seen in below.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Example usages:
```

```

Similar to View Student, if the there are 2 or more students with the same name, the program would prompt the user to input the corresponding phone number of the student that they would like to edit.


### Restore a student to the working list `restore`

mario
Student has been restored!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

### Undo a delete and restore the deleted student to the working list `undo`

### Display the list of students `list`
Displays the list of all students, or students with a specified subject. 
The user can further specify if they would like to display the full student list, 
the list with the total classes attended, as well as the list of students in the archive or in the recently deleted list.

**Format:** `list`

Allows the user to specify a subject, then displays all students with that subject. 
If the field is left blank, students will be displayed regardless of the subjects they have.

The user can then select by index, from 5 additional options.
1. Full student list
2. List of students with total classes attended
3. List of students with phone number shown
4. List of students in archive
5. List of students in recently deleted
Alternatively, the user can choose to display either the students in the recently deleted list or the archive.

Do note that there is a difference between 0 and no classes attended found. If the program displays 0 classes attended,
it means that the user entered the field 0 when adding the student. 
If it says no classes found, it means the user skipped that field when adding the student.

Important: If the input is invalid in the indexed portion of the list, e.g. the user types in `6`, `hello` or presses `enter`, the
list command would terminate.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Plug out the corresponding drive from the computer you would like to transfer from, and connect it to either the SATA or m.2 port of the computer you would like to transfer to. Please make sure to reinstall any existing drivers to ensure maximum compatibility.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer **without** removing any components?

**A**: In the jar directory (folder containing jar file), data is stored in the "data" folder (./data). You can import the contents within this data directory to that of the jar directory on the new computer.

**Q**: What inputs are not allowed?

**A**: The inputs that are banned (which are used for file saving) are `#` and `~`, and in all cases except for dates, `-`. 

**Q**: (Follow up from above) Why are other special characters not banned?

**A**: Due to the ever-changing climate of what is considered a name (and more), we have limited the bans to 3 special characters above only. In the event your name or other identification metrics contains `#`, `~` or `-`, we seek for your understanding.

**Q**: What happens if my data file gets corrupted?

**A**: We recommend manually looking through the data file and rectifying any errors, or by running Classify with a corrupted data file, the prompts on screen will guide you to delete all data in the file to restore Classify to a working state.
