## Preface
With the increased competitiveness of cohorts in Singapore, tuition centres have become more prevalent than ever before. 

According to a **[newspaper article](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/families-spent-14b-on-private-tuition-for-kids-last-year-as-parents-fork-out)** in The Straits Times, billions of dollars are spent in the tuition industry in Singapore every single year. 

These are just the numbers in Singapore. If we go to other countries, the situation is much worse. In India, new tuition centres preparing students for competitive entrance exams like JEE and NEET spring up every single day.

In such a fast-growing market, it is important that these tuition centres use better and more efficient student management systems to increase efficiency and automation of manual laborious tasks.

These systems enable tutors and administrative staff to focus on more pressing issues and work on catering to every students' needs instead of being swamped with paperwork.

## Introduction

Classify is a student management system meant to assist administrative staff of private tuition centres. 

The product is capable of storing students, and generating outputs based on provided parameters, such as phone number, or subjects taken.

Within our program, a student can be stored with their 
- Subjects taken
- Number grades of those subjects
- Phone Number
- Gender
- Last Payment Date
- Remarks

We have determined these to be the attributes important to running a working tuition centre. Based on these attributes, our program also has functions to sort students based on subjects taken.

# Usage

**Please note that if any of the following characters are entered in any string prompts, `#, - and ~`, they will be replaced and your command may be deemed invalid.**

### Adding a student: `add`
Initialises an interface for adding a student and their relevant details to the database. Allows the user to do add or add [name]

Students of the same name can be added so long as they possess a different phone number. Students with the same phone number can be added so long as they have different names.

User is expected to add only student's name as registered in NRIC or passport. 

The first letter of the student's name will be capitalised, while the 2nd letter onwards will be lowercase, regardless of initial input.

However, if the name contains multiple parts, each corresponding first letter after every space will be capitalised as well.

Example:
- James wong bing xuan -> James Wong Bing Xuan
- james WONG BING XUAN -> James Wong Bing Xuan
- jaMeS WONG binG Xuan -> James Wong Bing Xuan

Format: `add` or `add NAME`

Depending on whether the user entered the student's name or not during the command, fields will be printed out in the terminal, awaiting a user input each time.

Please note that the user input NUMBER (shown below) must be an *8-digit number starting with 8 or 9*. 
Thus, please be informed and educated that our software only works in countries that have phone numbers that are 8 digits long and start with 8 or 9.
To be specific, this is referring to a city-state republic in South East Asia, that lies in the timezone GMT +8 in the Straits of Johor. 
Some may debate that our time zone is actually GMT+7.5 or GMT+7, but it was changed to facilitate business deals and decisions with other financial hubs in the region thanks to our capitalistic overlords.

Last payment date must be within a range from 1970-01-01 to the day after the current date. This is a buffer to account for situations when storing dates, such as for audit reasons.

#### Example usage:
``` 
add wario

Subject (enter nothing to skip): 
SUBJECT

Current marks out of 100 (blank to skip) : 
100

Enter Classes Attended (blank to skip):
1

Do you want to add another subject and grade? (yes/no) 
no

Please input a valid Phone number: 
89718971
.
.
```

###  View details of a student `view`

Views a student's details. Allows the user to do view [name] or just view.

Format: `view` or `view NAME`

Depending on whether the user entered the student's name or not during the command, fields will be printed out in the terminal, awaiting a user input each time.
If user enters different letter cases from name stored data, the system will still match strings regardless of letter case for user intuitiveness.

How it works (cases for input):
- In the list: Stored as `James Wong`
- view James Wong -> James Wong
- view james wong -> james wong
- view JAMES WONG -> JAMES WONG
  * Regardless of what capitalisation the user uses for the name, the program will recognise that upper and lower cases should return the same student.

#### Example usage:
``` 
view wario

Student details: 
Name: wario
Phone Number: 97655678
Gender: male
Last Payment Date: 12/12/2023
Remarks: Unknown
Subject: subject
Current marks out of 100: 100.0
Classes Attended: 1
```
For any student that exists within the programme's master, archive and recently deleted list, the user cannot add new students with a name-phone number pair that matches that of the existing student.

The following is an example of trying to add a new student that matches the name and phone number of an already existing student.

#### Example usage:
```
add melodie
Subject (enter nothing to skip):
No subjects added.
Please input a valid phone number:
Enter a non-number or blank to exit interface.
88888888
Student and Phone number pair found. If not found in the list, please restore or unarchive the student instead.

```

### Delete a student from the working list `delete`

Format: `delete` or `delete NAME`

a field will be printed out in the terminal, awaiting a user input.

#### Example usage:
```

Enter student name: 
wario
Student removed successfully!
```

### Edit details of a student `edit`
Edit a student's details and subjects. Allows the user to do edit [student] or just edit.

Format: `edit` or `edit NAME`

If user has not entered a name, they will be prompted to input a name.
Once programme received name input, the student master list will be searched for the name. Name search is not case-sensitive.

If the name input matches that of an existing student, edit mode will be entered for that student.
If 2 students with the same name is found, the user will be prompted to enter the desired student's phone number to select them.

In edit mode, a list of actions will be printed and user can choose from a list of actions to take.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Plug out the corresponding drive from the computer you would like to transfer from, and connect it to either the SATA or m.2 port of the computer you would like to transfer to. Please make sure to reinstall any existing drivers to ensure maximum compatibility.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer **without** removing any components?

**A**: In the jar directory (folder containing jar file), data is stored in the "data" folder (./data). You can import the contents within this data directory to that of the jar directory on the new computer.

**Q**: What inputs are not allowed?

**A**: The inputs that are banned (which are used for file saving) are `#` and `~`, and in all cases except for dates, `-`. 

**Q**: (Follow up from above) Why are other special characters not banned?

**A**: Due to the ever-changing climate of what is considered a name (and more), we have limited the bans to 3 special characters above only. In the event your name or other identification metrics contains `#`, `~` or `-`, we seek for your understanding.

**Q**: What happens if my data file gets corrupted?

**A**: We recommend manually looking through the data file and rectifying any errors, or by running Classify with a corrupted data file, the prompts on screen will guide you to delete all data in the file to restore Classify to a working state.
