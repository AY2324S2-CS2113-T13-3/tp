## Project: Classify

Classify is a desktop application used for Tuition Centres to allow for easier management of their enrolled students. 
From allowing users to add new students to sorting them based on their last paid date, Classify is the one-stop app that
all Tuition Centres can employ for ease of student management. To use the app, users can interact with it using CLI.

    * Majority of my code was done to ensure my group member's code worked well with each other. I focused on making sure everything worked smoothly, and fixing bugs and exceptions, rather than adding features. Essentially acted as the scrum master.
