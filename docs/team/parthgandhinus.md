## Project: Classify

Classify is a desktop application used for Tuition Centres to allow for easier management of their enrolled students. 
From allowing users to add new students to sorting them based on their last paid date, Classify is the one-stop app that
all Tuition Centres can employ for ease of student management. To use the app, users can interact with it using CLI.
Overall, the code base has more than 3kLoC, and is written in Java.
